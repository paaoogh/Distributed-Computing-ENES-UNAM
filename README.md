##INTRODUCTION: Overview
Given the current situation in the world, keeping up with the news surrounding the globe is becoming more and more difficult for the average social media user, and even worse: for the organisms and industries advocated to the user comprehension. There might be multiple ways of understanding the social media behaviour, not only by following the biggest influencers and tracking every single user but also by keeping record of the trending topics within the industry. According to Google Trends (2020), over the last year (March 2019, March 2020), Mexicans verge on showing an interest in social media between 54% and 100% of the time. Understanding the behavior of the average person that uses social media can be a key towards understanding the social behaviour of a city, nation or the world:\

>We advocate for free expression and protectig the health of the public conversation around the world. (Twitter, 2020)

This project aims to make a distributed system that helps the understanding of the above mentioned by showing graphs and retreiving a weekly report of the trending topics displayed in a geographic area (Mexico). Data will be acquired by the contribution of Twitter APIs. Displaying descriptive staticstics will be our main goal.\ 

###Technique and Methodolgy
Following the eXtreme Programming schema, the Twitter APIs will be the data provider that will allow the personal computer to send the data to a server. The final client will be able to get the data needed in the form of diverse graphs.\

Tools needed:
    *Python programming language
    *Json
    *Lighttpd
    *Tweepy
    *Other python libraries: pandas
    *Visual Studio Code

Run the retreive.py program for the data fetching. It will be stored in a .csv file that will be processed later. Conection with the API is stablished within the program.

##REQUIREMENTS:
As working with data, Twitter needs to generate a *developer account*. In order to get credentials for the retrieving, [requesting](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) access is mandatory. Do take into consideration that the inquiry will take a couple days until the Twitter Team agrees to provide their services.\


##CONCLUSIONS:
The project will have several stages to follow, so comments will be submited when apropiate.\
